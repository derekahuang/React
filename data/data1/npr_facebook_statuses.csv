New Orleans is a place for every kind of convergence. The culture hums in an endless exchange, with history always close at hand. Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah understands this to his core: He grew up immersed in ritual Mardi Gras Indian traditions, and distinguished himself as a jazz trumpeter by his early teens. He's now shaping his own artistic reality, creating what he calls ""Stretch Music,"" a proud hybrid of styles and approaches, with a strong underlay of groove. Check out CHRISTIAN SCOTT QUINTET with Jazz Night In America.

Reed was on tour in Eastern Europe with his flagship band, People, Places & Things. While passing through the Czech Republic by train, they were menaced by a group of neo-Nazis, narrowly escaping harm through the intervention of riot police. Later, mulling over these events, Reed decided to create a suite called Flesh & Bone. After its concert premiere at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2015, it was released as an album last year.
 
Jazz Night In America asked Reed to recount that instigating flare of racial tension, which hasn’t lost any of its relevance in the years since.

2 cups whole raw cranberries, washed
1 small onion
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup sugar
2 tbs horseradish from a jar (red is a bit milder than white)

Grind the raw berries and onion together. (I use an old-fashioned meat grinder. I'm sure there's a setting on the food processor that will give you a chunky grind — not a puree.)

Add everything else and mix. Put in a plastic container and freeze.

Several hours before serving, move it from the freezer to the refrigerator compartment to thaw. (It should still have some icy slivers left.) The relish will be thick, creamy and shocking pink. (OK, Pepto-Bismol pink.)

Makes 1 1/2 pints. The relish has a tangy taste that cuts through and perks up the turkey and gravy. It's also good on next-day turkey sandwiches, and with roast beef.
