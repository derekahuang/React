Medics currently have to rely on expensive, cumbersome scans, such as X-rays, to figure out exactly where their instruments are. The new camera works in conjunction with an optical fibre, placed on an instrument inside the body, which emits pulses of laser light. Individual particles of light, called photons, are detected by the camera after passing through as much as 20cm of tissue. By measuring the time taken for them to reach the camera, it is possible to work out the instrument's exact position.

Making energy without oxygen creates lactic acid, the buildup of which can damage tissues in other vertebrates. But these fish convert it into ethanol, which seeps out into surrounding water. Research published in Scientific Reports points to a spare set of proteins, that divert energy-rich molecules into a kind of cellular distillery. Blood-alcohol concentrations of crucian carp in icy ponds can surpass 50mg/100mL—above the drink-drive limit in some countries. That permits them to survive in waters inhospitable to other fish. And it probably makes the overwintering a bit less dreary.",,video,https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/videos/10155749435264060/,2017-08-21 11:00:00,269,17,52,221,2,27,19,0,0,0
